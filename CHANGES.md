# Changes

Each entry: what changed, how it was tested, and what is still unproven.

## 0.1.1 (2026-11-09): fixes from the independent audit

An independent review of v0.1 checked the parser's output against the six sample PDFs and found 18 milestones marked **ok** that should not have been, plus Charlotte's whole milestone section going unread. All of them are fixed below.

### What changed

- **Unproven scope is no longer a guess.** A ranked list with no clear "franchise" or "NBA" heading used to be treated as franchise history. It is now `unknown` and the milestone is marked **review**. (Atlanta: 14 milestones moved from ok to review.)
- **Qualified lists go to review.** Lists limited to centers, bench players, a draft class, rookies, "since 2000", per-game figures, home games and similar cases can't be treated as all-time records. They are flagged for review, and their stat is recorded as `list`, not as plain points or rebounds (San Antonio: Keldon Johnson vs. Malik Rose).
- **Averages go to review.** A gap such as "29.4 vs 30.1 PPG" isn't a counting milestone (Lakers: Dončić vs. Chamberlain).
- **Charlotte's format is read.** Bullets such as "Grayson Allen is 93 rebounds away from 1,500 career rebounds... 36 games away from 500 career games played" are split at "..." and each part becomes its own milestone. Charlotte now yields 55 milestones. Value-first lists such as "701 Dell Curry 1988-98" are read too.
- **Two PDF-reading bugs fixed:**
  - Tightly justified lines lost all their spaces ("NazReidis89points..."). Their word breaks are space glyphs only 0.07pt wide, and those used to be thrown away. They are now kept. Audit: all 12,301 lines of the six samples were compared old vs. new. 176 changed, and every change only added whitespace.
  - The last bullet of a list ran into the heading below it, so Coby White's "25 games away from 500" was dropped. The bullet is now cut at the sentence end when that is what makes it readable.
- **The opponent is read per table cell.** Cleveland's front page puts "CAVS QUICK FACTS" and a schedule row ("12/12 vs. Warriors") on the same printed line, and the reader picked Golden State. Each cell is now scored on its own: both teams named (+3), tonight's date in the cell (+2), near the top (+1).
- **Merging duplicates.** Duplicates are merged only when they are the same player, stat and target (or the same passed player and scope). Different lists no longer swallow each other.
- **Roster names.** Suffixes (Jr., III) are stripped before checking a name.
- **The notes watcher never crashes and never corrupts its store:**
  - Every failure (offline, 403, an HTML block page, a body that fails mid-read, a truncated PDF) comes back as a status.
  - Files are written atomically (temp file, then rename).
  - A damaged index is set aside with a warning.
  - `latest.json` follows the newest version.
  - A file dated tonight that names a different opponent is reported as **conflict**, not as tonight's notes.
- **Truncated downloads.** A download is accepted only if `%%EOF` appears in its last 1KB. An earlier `%%EOF` from an incremental update no longer passes a cut-off file.

### Tested

- 154 hand-verified facts and checks pass, including:
  - every case the audit raised;
  - all six front pages (date and opponent);
  - 13 watcher situations, run with a fake network;
  - the invariant that no milestone with unknown scope, a qualifier, an average or an unresolved tie is ever **ok**.
- The snapshot was reviewed line by line before it was accepted. Each changed value was checked against the PDF text (Charlotte franchise lists: LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Brandon Miller; Lakers 50- and 60-point games).

Current output:

| Team | Milestones | ok | review |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLE | 70 | 66 | 4 |
| LAL | 173 | 172 | 1 |
| CHA | 55 | 52 | 3 |
| SAS | 51 | 42 | 9 |
| PHX | 15 | 15 | 0 |
| ATL | 15 | 1 | 14 |

### Still unproven

- **Only six PDFs from one night have been tested.** Other teams' layouts, and these teams' layouts later in the season, are unseen.
- **Current totals come only from the notes.** Nothing yet rolls them forward or cross-checks them against box scores, which needs NBA/ESPN data access.
- **Scope can be conservative.** Some lists that really are franchise lists are marked unknown and go to review (Charlotte rebounds, blocks and free throws; most of Atlanta).
- **"Career" is assumed for round-number milestones.** That is right for every sample so far, but it isn't checked.
- **The roster comes from the notes,** not from an official roster feed.
- **Old pages can survive in current notes.** A file can be dated tonight and still carry a page from an earlier game. The date check doesn't catch that.
- **Two copies of the watcher could collide.** There is no lock, so the scheduler must run one at a time.
- **Records like "185-89" can print as "185- 89".** That is how the PDF spaces them. Anything that later reads W-L records must allow spaces around the dash.
